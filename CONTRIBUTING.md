### Blaze.vue Contributing Guide
Hello! Thank you for choosing Blaze.vue.

Blaze is a Vue 2.0 based component library made for developers and designers, and an open source project by the developers at [Ample Organics](https://ampleorganics.com/careers/)

We are excited that you are interested in contributing to Blaze! Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to read through the following guidelines.

## Issue Guidlines
- Issues are for bug reports, feature requests, or any other discussions related to Blaze.

- Before submitting an issue, please check if a similar issue has already been created.

- When submitting an issue please specify what versions of `Blaze` and `Vue` you are using so that your issue can be reproduced.

- Please structure the title of your issue with `ComponentName: What the issue actually is`

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages should be formatted as `[Component Name]: Info about commit.` (e.g. `Button: Fix xxx bug`)

- Rebase before creating a PR to keep commit history clear.

- If your PR fixes a bug, please provide a description about the related bug.

- Merging a PR takes two maintainers: one approves the changes after reviewing, and then the other reviews and merges.

## Prerequisites
`Node.js 8.x`, `yarn` and `npm 5+` are required. Note: we use yarn to lock dependency versions, so you should install dependencies using yarn instead of npm install.
